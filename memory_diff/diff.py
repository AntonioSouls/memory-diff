# Diff class that models an object that allows you to make the difference between two files and save the difference to another file

class Diff:
    # CLASS CONSTRUCTOR: the object takes two files as parameters, where the first one we insert is the "new" one, the second one is the "old" one
    # I use the convenction that the new one that's what i have to compare with, so:
    #       - if diff returns ' ' it means that the analyzed line is the same in both files; 
    #       - if diff returns '+' it means that the analyzed line exist only in the right file of the diff (in our example it will be the old one). So, we have to remove that line from the old one;
    #       - if diff returns '-' it means that the analyzed line exist only in the left file of the diff (in our example it will be the new one). So, we have to add that line on the old one;
    #       - if diff returns ('-', '?', '+') it means that the analyzed line had some difference in the middle, so we will thake that line from the new file and save it in the old one
    #         removing the line that was already there
